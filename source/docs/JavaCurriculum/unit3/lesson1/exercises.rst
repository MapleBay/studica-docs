Below are a list of exercises to complete. Answers will be provided in the next section.

.. important:: To learn properly it is recommended to attempt the exercises before looking at the answers.

1. Write a program that displays each data type. An example output is shown.

.. code-block:: text

   byte: 125
   short: 32000
   int: 500000
   long: 9999999999
   float: 10.4
   double: -50112.56
   char: A
   boolean: true
   
2. Write a program that changes the value of a variable 3 times. An example output is shown.

.. code-block:: text

   Original: 105
   Change 1: 110
   Change 2: -15
   Change 3: 12
   
3. Add the following variables together.

.. code-block:: text

   int x = 10;
   int y = 12;
   int z = 42;
   
Example output

.. code-block:: text

   10 + 12 + 42 = 64

Challenge Question
------------------

.. note:: Challenge questions are here to stump you and test your problem solving skills. The content in a challenge question will be covered in later units.

4. Create a Pythagorean calculator. The user will input values for ``a`` and ``b``. The calculator should respond with the length of the hypotenuse.

The formula for Pythagorean theorem is: :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

Example

.. code-block:: text

   Welcome to the Pythagorean Calculator!!!
   
   Enter the length of side A: 3
   Enter the length of side B: 4
   Calculating
   The length of the hypotenuse is: 5
