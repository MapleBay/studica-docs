Why use Java?
=============

You may think that programming a robot is very difficult. However, programming that robot is easier that you might think, despite what others have been telling you. 

This is great time to learn programming. Countless programming tools and resources are available and other programmers distribute their work as open source so that other people can examine how that programs were written, fix errors, and contribute improvements.

It’s a great time to learn Java, because the language is everywhere. Billions of mobile devices us Android, and operating system whose apps are all written on Java.
This section of the guide aims to introduce Java programming to the following people:

1. Beginners who have never programmed before
2.	Those who have tried before but hated it
3.	Those who know another programming language and want to get up to speed in Java quickly

If you complete the first section you will have enough programming skills to be a danger to yourself and others. You’ll be able to begin to setup and program your robot and to follow more advanced lessons and example code more easily.

You will also have skills with Java, the most widely used programming language in the world.

The programing language that you choose often depends on what you have to accomplish. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses. For robot programming development we generally  have three choices of languages C/C++, LabVIEW, and Java.

Each of these languages has its adherents, but the most widely taught in computer science classes at the high school and college level is Java. This guide will use Java as the starting place for several reasons. One is that you can use Java across a variety of operating systems and computing environments. Java programs can be desktop software, web applications, Internet servers, Android apps, and more on Windows, Mac, Linux, and other operating systems. This provides a great deal of versatility.

Another advantage is that Java requires a highly organized approach for getting programs to work. Yo must be particular about how you write programs and how that store and alter data.

When you start writing Java you may not see this as an advantage and you may have several errors to fic before that program can be run. The benefit of this extra effort is that the programs you create will be more reliable and error free.
