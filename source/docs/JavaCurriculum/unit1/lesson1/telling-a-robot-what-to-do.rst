Telling a Robot What to Do
==========================

A computer program, also called software, is a way to tell a computer/controller/robot to perform a task. Everything that that controller does, from booting up to shutting down, is done by a program. MAC OS X is a program; Minecraft is a program; the driver that controls your printer is a program.

Computer programs are made up of a list of commands the computer/controller handles in a specific order when each program is run. Each command is called a statement.

If your boss was a control freak with a Type-A personality you would be given a detailed set of instructions to follow each day, like the following:

1. Enter the Building.
2. Turn on the lights.
3. Sit at your desk.
4. Turn on your computer.
5. Call Sam, Email Matt, and pick up Goat for lunch.

Hopefully however a critical thinker there can be a certain amount of leeway in how your tasks are completed. If the store is out of Tuna you could pick up Salmon sandwiches instead.

Computers donâ€™t do leeway. They follow instructions literally. The programs that you write are followed precisely, one instruction at a time.
