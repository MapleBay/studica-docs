What is a Machine?
==================

A machine, sometimes known as a computer is a device that has *hardware* and *software*. The hardware layer consists of physical nature. This is what can be seen by the human eye and felt. Software is the invisible layer that instructs the hardware on what to do. Knowing how hardware works, is not required; however, it will, in turn, make any code written more efficient and better. In this chapter, we will discuss how the hardware and software layers interact.

Components of a Machine

A machine has six core components:

-  Central Processing Unit ``CPU``
-  Memory ``RAM``
-  Storage ``Data``
-  Input Devices ``keyboard`` and ``mouse``
-  Output Devices ``speakers`` and ``monitors``
-  Communication ``ethernet`` and ``WiFi``

Central Processing Unit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *central processing unit* ``CPU`` is the brain of the whole operation. The CPU gets instructions from memory and acts on those instructions. When a CPU acts on instruction from memory, it is called executing. There are two primary components of a CPU, the *control unit* ``CU`` and the *arithmetic logic unit* ``ALU``. The control unit will instruct the components on what and when to do something. The arithmetic unit will perform any mathematical or logical operation. Below is a breakdown of the underlying architecture of a CPU.

A CPU is very advanced and has two main aspects of rating, *speed*, and amount of *cores*. The speed of a CPU is measured in *hertz* ``Hz``. 1 Hz is equal to 1 cycle per second. Some of today's high-end CPUs can hit 5 GHz, which is 5,000,000,000 cycles per second. The `Z3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)>`__, which was the first programmable digital computer, only had a speed of 4 - 5 Hz. The CPU's of today have multiple cores to increase the processing power. The picture above shows a single-core CPU as there is only one ALU and CU. Today's CPUs have 2,4,6,8,16,32+ cores. Shown below is a multicore processor with basic architecture.
