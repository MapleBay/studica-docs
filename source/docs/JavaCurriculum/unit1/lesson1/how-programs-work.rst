How Programs Work
=================

The collection of statements that make up a computer program is called its source code.

Most computer programs are written on the same way that you write an email – by typing each statement into a text window. Some programming tools come with their own source code editors and others can be used with any text-editing software.

When you have finished writing a program, you save the file to disk. Computer programs often have their own filename extension to indicate what type of file they are. Java programs must have the extension .java, as on Calculator.java.

To run a program you have saved as a file, you need some help. The kind of help required depends on the programming language you’re using. Some languages require an interpreter to run their programs. The interpreter examines each line of a computer program and executes that line. Then goes on to the next. Many versions of BASIC are interpreted languages.

The biggest advantage of interpreted languages is that they are faster to test. The primary disadvantage is that they run slower that other programs. Each line has to be translated into instructions the computer can run, one line at a time.

Other programming languages require a complier. The compiler takes a program and translates it into a front hat the computer can understand. It also makes the program run as efficiently as possible. The compiled program can be run directly without the need for an interpreter. Compiled programs run more quickly that interpreted programs but take more time to test. You have to write your program and compile the whole thing before trying to out. If you find an error and fix it, you mut compile the program again.

Java is unusual because it requires both a compiler and an interpreter. The compiler converts the statements that make up the program into bytecode that can be run by can interpreter called the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine, also called a JVM, is the thing that makes it possible for the same Java program to run without modification on different operating systems and different kinds of computing devices. The virtual machine turns bytecode into instructions that the device’s operating system can execute.


**When Programs Don't Work**

Many new programmers become discouraged when they start to test their programs. Errors appear everywhere. Some of these are syntax errors, which are identified by the computer as it looks at the program and becomes confused by the way a statement has been written. Other errors are logic errors, which only are noticed as the program is being tested.  Logic errors often cause it to do something unintended.

As you begin writing your own programs, you will become well-acquainted with errors. They’re a natural part of the process. You will get lots of experience fixing errors whether you like it or not.
