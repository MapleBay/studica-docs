Writing Your First Program Part 2
=================================

Creating the Robotics is awesome Program
----------------------------------------

   The first Java program that you will create will display the fact the we think "Robotics is awesome".

   When you run NetBeans for the first time after installation, you see a start page the displays links to tutorials and news. You can review these at any time.

   To prepare for the first programming project in NetBeans, we will create a new project called Robotics. A NetBeans project consists of a set of Java class libraries. Each project has its own folder, which you can explore and modify outside of NetBeans using text editors and other programming tools. 

   To begin a new project, click the New Project Button or choose the File, New Project menu command. The new Project wizard opens as shown.

   NetBeans can create several types of Java projects, for out use we will focus on one type: Java Application.

   Choose the project category Java with Maven and the project type Java Application and then click Next.
   
   Enter Robotics as the projects name
   
   Click Finish
   
   The Robotics project is created in its own folder. You can use this project for the Java programs that you write as you progress though these tutorials.
   
Beginning the Program
---------------------

   NetBeans groups related programs together into a project. The Robotics project appears in the Projects pane net to a coffee cup icon and a + sign that can be expanded to see the files and folders that the project contains.
   
   To add a new Java program to the currently open project, choose File, New File. The New File Wizard opens, as shown.

   The Categories pane lists the different kinds of Java programs you can create. Click the Java folder in this pane to see the file types that belong in this category. For this first project, choose the Empty Java File type and click Next.
   
   A Mew Empty Java File dialog opens. Follow these steps to begin writing the program:
   
   1.	In the Class Name Field, enter Robotics.
   2.	In the Package filed, enter com.robotics.
   3.	Click Finish.
   
   So you can begin working right away on your program, an empty file name Robotics.java opens on the source code editor. Using the editor, begin your Java programming career by entering each line of code from the sample below. These statements are called the programs source code.
