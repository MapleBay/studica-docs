Choosing a Java Programming Tool
================================

To start writing Java programs, you must have a Java programming tool. Several such programs are available Java, including the simple Java Development Kit and more sophisticated Eclipse and NetBeans. The latter tools are each an integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful tool used by programmers to get work done.
 
Whenever Oracle releases a new version of Java, the first tool that supports it is the Java Development Kit (JDK). The NetBeans IDE, is also offered for free by Oracle and is a much easier way to JDK, running behind the scenes, so you must have both tools on your system when you begin developing Java programs. For the first portion of these tutorials where we a getting an introduction to Java we will use NetBeans, which we will download and install separately from the JDK. 

Later on for our robotics applications we will use Visual Studica Code. Visual Studio Code is the supported development environment for C++ and Java, two of the three supported languages used for programming an FRC robot. Both are object-oriented text based programming languages. A program in C++ (for FRC) consists of a number of header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files where as a program in Java consists of .java files contained in one or more packages.
