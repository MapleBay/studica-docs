Installing the Java Development Tool
====================================

You can’t do any programming if you lack a Java programming tool on your computer. You can download the software, available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, from Oracle. You must have NetBeans and the JDK installed on your computer.

The JDK and NetBeans are downloaded as installation wizards that setup the software on your system. You can install the software in any folder and menu group that you like, but it’s best to stick with the default setup options.

Please ensure that you select versions of NetBeans and the SDK that are currently compatible.

1. The Java JDK can be found `here <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__ from the Oracle website. 

2. NetBeans a very popular Java IDE can be found `here <https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html>`__ from the Apache website.
