Exercises 
=========

Below are a list of exercises to complete. Answers will be provided in the next section. 

.. important:: To learn properly it is recommended to attempt the exercises before looking at the answers.

.. hint:: All programs except the challenge will only require ``System.out.println();`` or ``System.out.print();``.

1. Write a program that will display the following in the output console:

.. code-block:: text

   Hello World!
   It is very nice to meet you.
   This is one of my first Java programs.
   
2. Write a program that will display the following in the output console:

.. code-block:: text

   RRRRR    OOO    BBBBB    OOO   TTTTT
    R  R   O   O   B   B   O   O    T 
    RRRR  O     O  BBBB   O     O   T 
    R  R   O   O   B   B   O   O    T 
   RR   R   OOO    BBBBB    OOO     T 
   
3. Write a program that will create a table like this:

.. code-block:: text

   x     x^2      x^3      x^4
   1     1        1        1
   2     4        8        16        
   3     9        27       81
   4     16       64       256
   5     25       125      625
   
4. Write a program that will display the result of:

   .. math::
      
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
   
5. Write a program that will disapply the result of:

   .. math::

      \begin{equation}
      \frac{10.6 * 4.0 - 3.2 * 1.0}{20.6 - 1.8}
      \end{equation}
      
6. Write a program that converts 30°C to Fahrenheit

.. hint:: The formula is :math:`\begin{equation}\frac{9}{5}*C+32\end{equation}`


Challenge Question
------------------

.. note:: Challenge questions are here to stump you and test your problem solving skills. The content in a challenge question will be covered in later units. 

7. Add onto question 6 by having the user input a value in Celsius to be converted.

Example the user inputted 30°C

.. code-block:: text

   Enter the temperature to convert in °C: 30
   30°C is equal to 86°F
   
.. note:: A user might input a value such as 30.5
