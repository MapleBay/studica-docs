Trainer Tutorial
================

.. note:: It is highly recommended to complete the Java Curriculum before attempting this section.

This tutorial will show and explain how to program the `Studica FRC Training Robot <https://www.studica.com/us/en/Studica-Robotics/frc-training-bot.html>`__. This includes:

-  Creating a subsystem that contains code for using the TitanQuad and NavX built into the VMXpi
-  Creating a command to drive the robot around 
-  Creating a gamepad constants class to map out specific controllers we wish to use
-  Populating the RobotMap class to map out the electrical inputs of the robot
-  Populating the OI class to receive joystick input
-  Modifying the subsystem and command to use the built in WPILib MecanumBot class
