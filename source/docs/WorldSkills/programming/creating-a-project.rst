Creating a Project
==================

This guide will show ho to create a Java or C++ project for use in robotics

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Java
      
      Open the appropriate VS Code ``FRC VS Code 2020`` and hit ``CTRL + Shift + P``. This will open the command palette in VS Code. Consult the Getting to know VS Code section if you are unsure of what to do!
      
      In the command palette search for the command ``WPILib: Create a new project``. An example is shown below.
      
      .. figure:: images/java/creating-a-project-1.png
         :align: center
        
      This will open the project creator window
      
      .. figure:: images/java/creating-a-project-2.png
         :align: center
         
      1. Start by clicking on the *Select a project type (Example or Template)* button and select ``template``
      
      2. Chose a programing language by selecting the *Select a language* button. In this case ``Java``
      
      3. For *Select a project base* select ``Old Command Robot``
      
      4. Chose a folder location to store the project
      
      5. Enter an appropriate project name
      
      6. Enter your team number
      
      An example of a filled out project creator is shown below
      
      .. figure:: images/java/creating-a-project-3.png
         :align: center
         
      Hit *Generate Project* to finilize the creation of the project. There will be a prompt as shown to open in a new window or the current window. A new window will open another instance of VS Code whereas the current window will close the any open project you have and place this project in the currently opened VS Code window.
      
      .. figure:: images/java/creating-a-project-4.png
         :align: center
      
      .. note:: The project will then automaticaly build the for the first time. If the build is not successful constult the troubleshooting section
      
      The VS Code window should now look like this and a Java project has been created!

   .. tab:: C++
      
      .. caution:: Anti-virus might need to be disabled in order for a C++ project to compile

      3. For *Select a project base* select ``Command Robot``
